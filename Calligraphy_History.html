                                <h3>1. Calligraphy history: Where does calligraphy come from?</h3>
                                <p>Ever wondered where Calligraphy comes from? In this brief history of Calligraphy
                                    post, we will dig into
                                    some books and go back to the beginning of writing history so that we can understand
                                    the origin of
                                    letterforms.</p>
                                <img src="../TH2012E_Project_Sem1/img/history2.webp" alt="">
                                <p>If you are able to see, then chances are you are being exposed to letterforms daily,
                                    even though sometimes
                                    we take them for granted and pay little to no REAL attention to them.</p>
                                <p>In our everyday life, we are dependent on letters to navigate the world, express
                                    ourselves, as well as
                                    communicate with others.Letters allow us to convey information, set warnings, or
                                    consume and produce
                                    education, like this post you are reading right now.</p>
                                <p>
                                    In this digital era, it's easier than ever to have access to different fonts and
                                    tools that allow us to
                                    create from simple documents to intricate work of art.</p>
                                <p>But where do letters come from, and how have they evolved over time?
                                    In this post, and with the help of a handy list of amazing books (check the full
                                    list of books at the
                                    bottom) I will cover all these points in the history of Calligraphy.</p>
                                <p><b>So let’s start with the basics!</b></p>
                                <h3>2. THE MEANING OF THE WORD CALLIGRAPHY</h3>
                                <p>Calligraphy means beautiful writing and comes from the Greek “καλλιγραφία” words
                                    “beauty” (Kallos) and “to
                                    write” (Graphein).And while the meaning of the word is “beautiful writing” I think
                                    we can agree that
                                    Calligraphy is much more than just a way to write words in a beautiful way.</p>
                                <p>Calligraphy is a fine art, like painting, sculpture, drawing or photography. It’s a
                                    way of seeing life and
                                    telling what you see.</p>
                                <p>Through calligraphy, you can learn about proportion, positive and negative space,
                                    depth perception, and
                                    light.</p>
                                <p>Through calligraphy, we can elevate a message, since people respond to the qualities
                                    of a well-executed
                                    piece. That brings a special punch to the intellectual meaning of the words.</p>
                                <p>A well-constructed piece has three dimensions, a fine art, a craft, and a literary
                                    art.</p>
                                <p>It’s up to the Calligrapher to bring all of them together as a tricking idea with a
                                    high level of
                                    craftsmanship of fine materials and a carefully chosen message, but what makes
                                    calligraphy so meaningful is
                                    passion, and the way each individual artist can express him/herself through the
                                    words and lines of this art
                                    form. (1)</p>

                                <h3>11. THE EVOLUTION OF LETTERFORMS</h3>
                                <p>The Celtic scribes of the Dark Ages and the Gothic scribes of the Middle Ages worked
                                    indoors and used small
                                    pens made out of feather quills, writing small letters. Their main concern was to
                                    copy, glorify, and
                                    preserve the text of the Christian religion.</p>
                                <p>During the Renaissance, Greek and Roman ideas were rediscovered, and with them, the
                                    formally carved
                                    capitals of classical inspiration and the pen capitals of early manuscripts were
                                    brought back to the
                                    spotlight.</p>
                                <p>At the same time, the invention of movable type and the adoption of papermaking
                                    technology from Central
                                    Asia helped the printing press to replace the scribe as the main way to produce and
                                    reproduce books.</p>
                                <p>As David Harris stated in his book, no reference to the historical mechanics of
                                    Calligraphy is completed
                                    without a reference to Edward Johnston’s Foundational Hand and it’s simplicity and
                                    integrity.</p>
                                <p>Historically, Foundational hand belongs to the early 20th century, however, the basis
                                    for the script is a
                                    manuscript dating for rage year 966, the Ramsey Psalter. It is believed to have been
                                    produced by scribes at
                                    Winchester.</p>
                                <p>The Ramsey Psalter was written in a hand now known as the English Caroline Minuscule,
                                    and Anglicized
                                    version of Frankish Caroline Minuscule.</p>
                                <p>For three centuries, master typographers and their apprentices perfected the design,
                                    cutting, casting, and
                                    setting of mechanically perfect type fonts.</p>
                                <p>This new visual purity of type became the new standard of reading formats for an in
                                    recently literate
                                    public.</p>
                                <p>As more people read, more and more people wrote, as mail delivery became more
                                    reliable, writing letters
                                    became a necessity to communicate in the distance. People modeled their handwriting
                                    as it was considered a
                                    sign of status and education.</p>
                                <p>During the industrial revolution Calligraphy hit the lowest point in history, as the
                                    professional scribe’s
                                    profession disappeared and manufactured books, textiles and housewares drove
                                    handmade things out of fashion.
                                </p>
                                <p>Calligraphy was revived again during England’s Arts and crafts movements, along with
                                    many medieval
                                    techniques for cutting pens, mixing inks, and laying gold leaf to name a few.

                                </p>
                                <p>Calligraphy and the related book arts began to attract designers and visionaries who
                                    revitalized the
                                    typeset page by reconnecting it to the handwritten manuscripts.

                                </p>
                                <p>Another wave of interest in calligraphy swept North America in the 1970s as cartridge
                                    pens, markers and
                                    copies brought the mechanics of the craft to the threshold of the hobbyist. (2)

                                <p>Amateurs found themselves with access to standardized, reliable, and inexpensive

                                <h3>12. THE HISTORY OF COPPERPLATE</h3>
                                <p>As we are focusing more on Modern Calligraphy, we have to pay some special attention
                                    to the inception of
                                    Copperplate.</p>
                                <p>The development of Copperplate as a calligraphic style must be studied within the
                                    context of European
                                    history.</p>
                                <p>Two major factors combined to establish the importance of Copperplate in the 18th
                                    century: The stature of
                                    England as an important economic power and the development of metal plate-engraving.
                                </p>
                                <p>By the mid-17th century, England was well established commercially with a huge
                                    upsurge in trade.</p>
                                <img src="../TH2012E_Project_Sem1/img/history11.webp" alt="">
                                <p>With the rise of a business class, came a need for scribes, educated in record
                                    keeping and writing.</p>
                                <p>Education flourished, and writing schools were established where young men could
                                    learn accounting and
                                    penmanship. By the beginning of the 18th century, the age of the English masters was
                                    in full bloom.</p>
                                <p>Masters seeking pupils to take under their wing took to printed advertising to
                                    attract more suitors to
                                    their classes. Oftentimes with elaborate and beautiful pieces of art that appealed
                                    to their skills as
                                    teachers, penmen, and scholars.</p>
                                <p>Many writing masters published copy books, printed text from which their students
                                    could copy the
                                    calligraphy of the (self-proclaimed) master scribe. These books served multiple
                                    purposes of attracting
                                    students, advertising the penman’s abilities with their tools, and at the same time
                                    show light to the lack
                                    of skills of the competition.</p>
                                <p>The method by which these books were reproduced was copperplate engraving, which
                                    consisted of incising fine
                                    lines onto a metal printing plate with a sharpened steel tool called burin.</p>
                                <p>The penman’s designs were transferred onto the plate in reverse by the engraved and
                                    could be corrected and
                                    adjusted before printing.</p>
                                <p>In 1570, the first writing book – a translation of Jean de Beauchesne’s French
                                    copybook, “A Booke
                                    Containing Divers Sorts of Hands”, published in Paris in 1550 – was engraved in
                                    England. (3)</p>
                                <p>As you might have guessed, the Copperplate hand developed from this new engraving
                                    method.</p>
                                <p>The most important innovation was that for the first time in Copperplate, all letters
                                    in a word were linked
                                    together. This made this particular hand faster to write and more practical.</p>
                                <p>The 17th and 18th centuries also saw the publication of dozens of elaborate and
                                    highly ornamented books by
                                    such penmen as Edward Cocker (1631-1676) and John Seddon (1644-1700), and while
                                    numerous copies were
                                    produced, only a few survived.</p>
                                <p>An invaluable source of Copperplate calligraphy is available thanks to George
                                    Bickman. He called upon
                                    twenty-five of the finest penmen in England between 1733 and 1741, to provide him
                                    with examples of their
                                    work. 212 of these engraving were later bound in book form to bring to life “The
                                    Universal Penman”</p>
                                <p>The calligraphic style that predominates in “The Universal Penman” which we call
                                    “Copperplate” was known in
                                    the 18th century as “Roundhand”.</p>
                                <img src="../TH2012E_Project_Sem1/img/history12.webp" alt="">
                                <p>In a way, the shapes of the letters were determined by the printing method. The
                                    combination of the pointed
                                    burin and the hard metal plate led to changes in letterforms from the italic and
                                    secretary hands of the 15th
                                    and 16th centuries. Curves became rounder, letter slant increased and the contrast
                                    between heavy and fine
                                    lines became more pronounced.</p>
                                <p>In England, “Roundhand” quickly gained favor as a business hand because of its speed,
                                    clarity, and
                                    legibility, eventually replacing many of the Humanist hands when it came to
                                    business, record keeping and
                                    important documents.</p>
                                <p>Copperplate letterforms survived through the 19th century, although the perception of
                                    the script of Beckham
                                    and his contemporaries was not equaled.</p>
                                <p>The surge of education in the 19th century led to the need for teachers to teach
                                    handwriting to the masses,
                                    a need that led to the dilution of the calligraphic mastery and ornamentation in
                                    favor of speed and
                                    legibility.</p>
                                <p>The invention of the ballpoint pen in the 20th century led to the end of an era,
                                    before, students were
                                    judged not only by the content of their work but also on their writing techniques.
                                </p>
                                <p>Slowly, the beauty and elegance of the writing word, as the tools changed, banished.
                                    To make room later for
                                    the word processor.</p>
                                <p>But as we now know, this was not the end for this beautiful art form, today more than
                                    ever the interest for
                                    the handcrafted quality and the handwritten word has given Calligraphy and
                                    Copperplate another revival.</p>
                                <img src="../TH2012E_Project_Sem1/img/history13.webp" alt="">
                                <p>Other styles like Spencerian and Edwardian, have been continued to be taught, but
                                    since they continue to be
                                    relatively inflexible with established letterforms to maintain their purity.</p>
                                <p>Modern calligraphers have been more encouraged than ever to develop their own
                                    personal styles, with their
                                    bases in older scrip styles, but adding their own expression to the strokes and
                                    letterforms.</p>
                                <p>And this movement that we now call Modern Calligraphy.</p>
