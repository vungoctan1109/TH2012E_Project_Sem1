                                <h2>1. What Calligraphy Is Not</h2>
                                <p>We'll start with a seemingly simple question: <strong>what is calligraphy</strong>,
                                    exactly? Although many
                                    will nod their heads in confirmation that they know the correct answer, putting it
                                    into words is a much
                                    bigger challenge. And, in all honesty, it's not surprising that many can't provide a
                                    reliable explanation of
                                    what calligraphy is as modern times definitely blurred the line of this discipline's
                                    description. In fact,
                                    the introduction of printing machines has been slowly deteriorating the reputation
                                    of calligraphy as
                                    everyone who needed something written usually opted for the more effective, faster
                                    and cheaper method. Such
                                    a situation only escalated with the inventions of home printers and computers.
                                    <strong>However, calligraphy
                                        managed to survive all the difficulties history placed before it and is still
                                        regarded as a valid
                                        artistic discipline despite flying a bit under the radar for centuries.</strong>
                                    In the remainder of
                                    this article, we will attempt to clarify and define what calligraphy exactly is and
                                    what it is not, as well
                                    as take a look at some contemporary occurrences that dictate the current direction
                                    of the lettering craft.

                                    width="855" height="401" class="size-full wp-image-336458"><br>
                                <p>The dictionary definition states that calligraphy is a <strong>skill of
                                        handwriting</strong>, or even
                                    something more vague as simply stating that it's <strong>beautiful writing</strong>.
                                    Although undeniably
                                    true, these interpretations do no justice to calligraphy as this craft is much more
                                    than just well-performed
                                    penmanship. In fact, it is these half-hearted theories that are dimming both the
                                    value and characteristics
                                    of the calligraphic discipline. Bear in mind that the primary goals of handwriting
                                    are being quick, easily
                                    written and accurately read. Beauty, personality and artistic impact all fall second
                                    to these demands and
                                    are not at all important in handwriting as clarity and speed. On the other hand,
                                    these are some of the key
                                    features calligraphy writing strives to achieve. Another common and obscure
                                    definition is that calligraphy
                                    is <strong>the process of making ornamentally decorated letters</strong>. This is,
                                    as well, partially true
                                    as dressing up the pages with different forms of decoration is a big part of the
                                    discipline. However, this
                                    is also just a segment of calligraphy as a whole and is far from a complete
                                    definition of the entire
                                    discipline.</p>

                                <p></p>
                                <p><strong>Calligraphy is the artistic process of forming beautiful symbols by hand and
                                        arranging them in a way
                                        that inscribes words that possess integrity, harmony, some sort of ancestry and
                                        rhythm.</strong> In this
                                    definition, <strong>integrity</strong> represents admirable proportions and design
                                    of letters and symbols in
                                    calligraphy images. <strong>Harmony</strong> is a pleasing relationship between the
                                    words, characters and
                                    single letter's elements. <strong>Ancestry</strong> refers to the preservation of
                                    heritage of letter-shapes,
                                    materials and techniques which calligraphers use. Finally, <strong>rhythm</strong>
                                    is a deliberate
                                    repetition in calligraphic writing that creates feelings of pattern and emphasis
                                    within the eyes of the
                                    viewer. On their own, any of these factors do not amount to a valid calligraphic
                                    discipline - only when they
                                    are all assembled together does the entire process start to take on a shape of
                                    calligraphy.</p>
                                <p>Many calligraphers agree that there is another ingredient in the mix of perfect
                                    lettering and that is
                                    <strong>creative fire</strong>.<sup>[1]</sup> A bit puzzling and nebulous, this can
                                    be explained as a
                                    slightly mysterious life and individuality of any piece of art. <strong>This
                                        individual stamp of the
                                        calligrapher’s personality on the work is ultimately what makes calligraphy a
                                        valid member of arts, it's
                                        the key aspect that separates it from conventional penmanship and any machine
                                        standardized letter
                                        form.</strong> Calligraphy aims to produce a reaction, just like any quality
                                    piece of sculpture or
                                    painting, its goals are to invoke a deeper meaning and communicate with the viewer
                                    on both the linguistic
                                    and creative level. Although a bit too metaphorical to be considered a valid
                                    definition, many experts
                                    recognize that reading calligraphy is the closest way one can get to hearing music
                                    with eyes. Interestingly,
                                    this may be the most precise explanation of what calligraphic creative fire actually
                                    is.

                                <p></p>
                                <p>Fully analyzing the entire history of calligraphy and all it's types is an almost
                                    impossible challenge, one
                                    that would take thousands upon thousands of pages to be considered comprehensive.
                                    Since the dawn of
                                    civilization, every single community had its own variant of calligraphy, all of
                                    which were founded between a
                                    mix of necessity and creative desires. All of them had differing styles and tools
                                    used.
                                    <strong>Calligraphers are very aware of such ancestry and it plays a major role in
                                        contemporary calligraphy
                                        which is shaped by a long, inventive heritage.</strong> In fact, imitating
                                    historical handwriting is a
                                    wide and encouraged method of achieving calligraphic success. Learning how to write
                                    in historical styles is
                                    an excellent means of training both the hand and the eye. It should be noted that
                                    mere copying of ancient
                                    handwriting does not represent the creative purpose of calligraphy. However, it does
                                    provide both a fine
                                    starting point for beginners and an interesting exercise for those with more
                                    experience. Many specialists
                                    agree that calligraphy can be classified into four broad categories: Western
                                    Calligraphy, Eastern Asian
                                    Calligraphy, Southern Asian Calligraphy and Islamic Calligraphy.<sup>[2]</sup>

                                <h3>Western Calligraphy</h3>
                                <p></p>
                                <p>Western Calligraphy emerged in the 10th century and still continues to evolve to this
                                    day.<sup>[3]</sup>
                                    Known for its strict rules and geometric patterns, this popular style is one of the
                                    most prominent example
                                    of calligraphic art. The most recognizable use of the Western lettering is in the
                                    <strong>Latin
                                        script</strong> which underwent numerous drastic changes over the centuries as
                                    the ruling dynasties
                                    switched places. The humanist minuscule of the Renesance was one of the crucial
                                    moments of this style, as
                                    well as the 17th-century Batarde and the English script about a hundred years
                                    younger. Different types of
                                    calligraphy require different tools. Traditionally, Western Calligraphy's tools
                                    include a flat-balled or
                                    round-nipped pen, a brush, water-based ink, high-quality paper or parchment, a knife
                                    for removing work and
                                    templates. </p>

                                <h3>Eastern Asian Calligraphy</h3>
                                <p></p>
                                <p>This particular style of lettering encompasses the calligraphy of China, Japan and
                                    Korea. Every single
                                    dynasty that ruled these lands had its own variants of calligraphy techniques and
                                    visuals. This style is
                                    easily recognizable as it's not difficult to distinguish Eastern symbols that have
                                    the purpose of entire
                                    words. Logically, their manuscripts are much shorter than those found in the Western
                                    territories. Eastern
                                    Asian Calligraphy is valued as a very important heritage in its respected countries
                                    and all of them dedicate
                                    much effort to making sure the local calligraphic techniques are well preserved.
                                    Technically speaking,
                                    Eastern calligraphers use paperweights and desk pads beside the usual writing
                                    equipment.</p>

                                    India, Nepal and Tibet.
                                    These manuscripts were widely used for various <a

                                    and secular purposes and
                                    could be seen being used in a lot of instances, starting from their prayer wheels to
                                    the letters of the
                                    Dalai Lama. With some of the examples going back to inscriptions in stone, pieces of

                                    Calligraphy can be described as some of the most ancient lettering practices ever
                                    discovered. Indian
                                    calligraphy was the most influential of the three and it had used many
                                    unconventional methods over the
                                    course of its existence, such as burnt mud, smoke treated palm leaves, copper and

                                <p>This style can be found as an essential element of Islamic art.<sup>[4]</sup> It uses
                                    unique geometric
                                    patterns and the best examples of these can be found on mosque walls. Islamic
                                    Calligraphy is considered to
                                    be the most beautiful example of lettering by many and it has evolved along with the
                                    progression of the
                                    religion and the Arabic language. It should be noted that Muslims view calligraphy
                                    as the highest kind of
                                    artistic expression since it is observed as the most efficient means of
                                    communicating with the spiritual
                                    world. The Ottoman Era is considered to be the peak of development of the Islamic

                                    aspects of lettering has changed since then, especially in more conservative circles
                                    of societies. However,
                                    modern times saw many alterations made to traditional lettering, resulting in a

                                <h2>4. The Modern Era of Calligraphy Writing</h2>
                                <p></p>
                                <p>After printing became ubiquitous during the 15th century, the production of
                                    illuminated manuscripts began
                                    their fast-paced decline in production. However, the rise of printing did not mean
                                    the ultimate end of
                                    calligraphy which retained a number of practitioners over the centuries. The modern
                                    revival of calligraphy
                                    began at the end of the 19th century and was influenced by the aesthetics and
                                    philosophy of William Morris
                                    who spurred the <strong>Arts and Crafts
                                        movement</strong></a>. The main figure of this calligraphic renaissance was
                                    <strong>Edward
                                        Johnston</strong>. He studied numerous manuscripts held at the British Museum
                                    which allowed him to teach
                                    courses in calligraphy, sharing his fascination with anyone interested. In his free
                                    time, Johnston was also
                                    designing typefaces, many of which are still used today. By doing so, Edward
                                    single-handedly <strong>revived
                                        artistic penmanship and lettering</strong>. His efforts influenced further
                                    generations typographers and
                                    calligraphers, having a strong impact on the works of Graily Hewitt, Stanley

                                    Eric Gill and Anna Simons.</p>
                                <p>An interesting feature that modern calligraphy introduced was that the letters were
                                    not always intended to be
                                    readable.<sup>[5]</sup> This characteristic did not rely on any historical practice
                                    at all, as all older
                                    manuscripts and similar documents had to be understandable to at least some
                                    audiences. Yet, by closing these
                                    particular doors to the past, practitioners of calligraphy opened new grounds which
                                    invigorated numerous
                                    experiments in the discipline. As a further consequence of such an abstract concept,
                                    many visual artists of
                                    the modern era were inspired to include calligraphic elements in their work, such as
                                    Twombly,
                                    and
                                    .Some younger
                                    artists also come to mind, including the likes of
                                    and Hongyu Zhang. Naturally, calligraphy found an
                                    interesting common ground with street expression as graffiti are a perfect technique
                                    for one to practice
                                    stylistic lettering. Some of the finest

                                <h2>5. The Importance of Calligraphy Art in the Contemporary World</h2>
                                <p></p>
                                <p>Since the introduction of computers and other technological accessories, it seems as
                                    though calligraphy is as
                                    distant from us as ever. However, such a rich tradition of this discipline has
                                    proven quite resilient and
                                    defiant to the modern times despite having to tackle more efficient methods.
                                    Although evicted from more
                                    casual and day to day activities, calligraphy still shows elegance, grace and
                                    distinction to our most
                                    significant documents. It is utilized for adding artistic touches to book designs,
                                    various invitations,
                                    inscriptions, logos, font design, certificates and records. Calligraphy is also
                                    often used for the likes of
                                    props and moving images for film and television, court testimonials and maps. It
                                    also plays the role of a
                                    majorinspiration for many alternative and
                                    unique artistic practices, such as writing stylized
                                    letters on girls or the
                                    notorious vagina
                                    lettering. <strong>Only when one analyzes all of the above mentioned practical uses
                                        does the whole
                                        picture of just how present calligraphy is in the contemporary
                                        world.</strong><sup>[6]</sup> Giving fine

                                    long as there is humanity and no amount of technological advancements can ever stand
                                    in the way of that.</p>

                                arts form.
                                Calligraphy remains perennially popular, often adorning invitations, diplomas and

                                it is Roman, Gothic, Celtic, Bookhand or Italic style, calligraphy conveys class and
                                elegance. Margaret
