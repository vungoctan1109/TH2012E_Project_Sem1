It replaced the earlier style of uncial writing, from which it differed in using smaller, more rounded and more connected letter forms, and in using many ligatures. Many of these forms had previously developed as parts of more informal cursive writing. The basic letter shapes used in the minuscule script are the ancestors of modern lower case Greek letters.</p>-->

                            <p>Arabic calligraphy was originally a tool for communication, but with time, it began to be used in
                                architecture, decoration and coin design. Its evolution into these major roles was a reflection
                                of the early Muslims’ need to avoid, as their beliefs required, figures and pictorials that were
                                used as idols before Islam was established in the Arabian Peninsula.

                            </div>
                            <p>While the Arabic tribes preferred to memorize texts and poetry, the first Muslims tried to
                                document their holy book (Qur’an Kareem) using the scripts that we’ll look at in this article.
                                In order to understand how these scripts developed into the beautiful and complex shapes we know
                                today, we have to understand the history of Arabic calligraphy. <br>

                                Over the course of their development, the Arabic scripts were created in different periods and
                                locations of the expansive Islamic Empire. There is also a close relationship between each
                                Arabic script and its common usage throughout history. This leads us to the question of why this
                                article is important, especially for non-Arabic speakers, and what information can be gleaned
                                from each script. <br>

                                Well, understanding the history of each script and how Arabic calligraphy evolved over the
                                history of the Islamic Empire can expand our visual experience beyond the beautiful glyphs and
                                forms. Some scripts reflect the time period in which they developed, such as the Musand script,
                                which emerged at an early stage in the history of Arabic calligraphy. Others provide
                                geographical insight into where the artwork was developed, such as the Maghribi script, which
                                distinguishes the artwork and inscriptions of northwest Africa.</p>
                            <h2>The Early Development Of Arabic Scripts</h2>
                            <p>Digging deep into the history of the Arabian Peninsula and the origin of the Arabic language,
                                archeologists have found inscriptions that show a close relationship between Arabic scripts and
                                some earlier scripts, such as the Canaanite and Aramaic Nabataean alphabets that were found in
                                the north of the Arabian Peninsula. These inscriptions were date to the 14th century BC.</p>

                            <h2>ARABIC MUSNAD</h2>
                            <p>The first Arabic script, Arabic Musnad, which likely developed from the above-mentioned
                                languages, doesn’t have the cursive aesthetic that most people associate with modern Arabic
                                scripts. Discovered in the south of the Arabian Peninsula, in Yemen, this script reached its
                                final form around 500 BC and was used until the 6th century. It did not look like modern Arabic,
                                as its shapes were very basic and resembled more the Nabataean and Canaanite alphabets than the
                                Arabic shapes.</p>

                            <h2>AL-JAZM</h2>
                            <p>The first form of an Arabic-like alphabet is known as the Al-Jazm script, which was used by
                                northern tribes in the Arabian Peninsula. Many researchers think the roots of this script go
                                back to the Nabatean script, and yet the early Arabic scripts also seem to have been affected by
                                other scripts in the area, such as the Syriac and Persian scripts. <br>

                                The Al-Jazm script continued to develop until the early Islamic era in Mecca and Medina in the
                                west of the Arabian Peninsula.</p>

                            <p>The Al-Jazm script developed into different styles, such as the Hiri, Anbari, Makki and Madani.
                                During this period, some other scripts developed, such as the Ma’il, which is considered the
                                predecessor of the Kufic script. Other scripts did not make it through the development process,
                                such as the Mukawwar, Mubsoott and Mashq (which you can read more about in “The Development of
                                the Arabic Script: A Brief History” by professor M.J. Alhabeeb of the University of
                                Massachusetts Amherst). Usually, these scripts were used before and during the early days of the
                                Islamic Empire in the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
                            <h2>KUFIC SCRIPT</h2>
                            <p>Following the Arabic Musnad and Al-Jazm, the Kufic script evolved as the next stage of Arabic
                                calligraphy’s development. Unlike those two old scripts, we can identify known letter shapes in
                                the early development of the Kufic script. <br>

                                As the Kufic script developed over the 7th century, it played an essential role in documenting
                                the Muslim holy book (Qur’an Kareem). The Kufic script is one of the oldest Arabic scripts that
                                persisted in common use until the 13th century. <br>

                                Its name refers to the city of Kufa in Iraq, where it first appeared, yet most instances of this
                                script were found nearly a thousand kilometers to the south in Medina in the Arabian Peninsula,
                                where the Prophet Mohammed stayed after moving from Mecca. <br>

                                In the early stages of its development, the Kufic script did not include the dots that we know
                                from modern Arabic scripts. The letter dots (Nuqat) were added during the later development of
                                this and other scripts. Also, at a later stage, Abul Aswad Al Du’ali (688 CE) and Al Khalil Ibn
                                Ahmed Al Farahidi (786 CE) developed the diacritical marks (Tashkeel) that indicate the vowels
                                of the letters. <br>

                                If we examine Kufic script inscriptions, we’ll notice particular characteristics, such as the
                                angular shapes and long vertical lines. The script letters used to be wider, which made writing
                                long content more difficult. Still, the script was used for the architectural decoration of
                                buildings, such as mosques, palaces and schools. <br>

                                These characteristics affected the usability of the script and made it more suitable for
                                architectural and written Islamic titles, instead of long texts.</p>
                            <h2>Conclusion On Arabic Calligraphy</h2>
                            <p>Arabic calligraphy has developed for over 14 centuries in various regions around the world. This
                                history and diversity has enriched Arabic scripts with ever more complex and artistic forms.
                                During this long period, the Baghdadi and Ottoman eras contributed the most to its development.
                                <br>

                                Arabic calligraphy is still today one of the most widely acknowledged arts and continues to
                                develop both in traditional methods as well as in digital and computer-generated arts. Arabic
                                calligraphers from around the world continue to develop their own styles and artwork based on
                                existing scripts and their own letters and scripts. Free modern scripts contribute to the art
                                just as much as traditional scripts have done.</p>
