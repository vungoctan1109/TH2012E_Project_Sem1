                            <!--                                        <p>Greek minuscule was a Greek writing style which was developed as a book hand in Byzantine manuscripts during the 9th and 10th centuries. It replaced the earlier style of uncial writing, from which it differed in using smaller, more rounded and more connected letter forms, and in using many ligatures. Many of these forms had previously developed as parts of more informal cursive writing. The basic letter shapes used in the minuscule script are the ancestors of modern lower case Greek letters.</p>-->

                            <p>
                                So that this course can be enjoyed by everyone, including those without previous knowledge of
                                Arabic, an introduction to the script and to the basics of that alphabet is necessary before we
                                start working with calligraphy proper. This is why this first lesson is unusually lecture-like.
                                However, even Arabic speakers may find here something they didn't know before, as we don't
                                necessarily learn much about the script itself in school or daily life. <br>

                                What I aim to teach in this new series of lessons is not the traditional flowing scripts that
                                the words "Arabic calligraphy" evoke. As beautiful as they are, they are very formal, and it
                                takes a long and repetitive apprenticeship to learn to draw them properly, and even longer to be
                                able to express oneself with them ("Make patient imitation your habit", said Ibn al-Baww√¢b, one
                                of the great names of the art). <br>

                                Only a handful of people in the world, today, do this at all; most practitioners are content
                                with using what they learned as they learned it, while large numbers of calligraphy students, I
                                have observed, lose interest long before they have put in enough practice to make anything of
                                it. <br>

                                This is not a criticism of this traditional approach: it is very beautiful, and it suits
                                many‚Äîbut not all. For those who want to use Arabic calligraphy (which I'll refer to as khatt) in
                                creative ways, I have put this course together, a web adaptation of the one I teach in London.
                                <br>

                                The course content is entirely original, as I have crystallized it from my own practice, the
                                basis of which I acquired from a non-traditional master who taught no theory at all but put me
                                to work for many years until this material was second nature. It may not, therefore, intersect
                                with any official courses taught by calligraphers with an official license (ij√¢za). <br>

                                The aim of the series is not to teach you how to faithfully imitate forms, but to give you an
                                understanding of the letters and how they are put together, so that you can then create with
                                them and make them your own, as I have done. To this end, we will be working with the Kufic
                                script.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Kufic vs. Rounded Scripts: A History</h2>
                            <p>Arabic calligraphic scripts can be divided into two great families: the so-called rectilinear
                                scripts (Kufic), and the cursive or round scripts. Although Kufic is too often presented as if
                                it were a single, specific script among the rest, that is a mistake, and it can be only be
                                reduced to a formula in an artificial way. To clarify this, I will briefly describe the
                                respective history of these two families and explain their fundamental differences. (Note that
                                all the names by which we designate the scripts are applied in retrospect. Period sources used
                                them more fluidly if at all.)</p>
                            <h3>Birth of the Rectilinear Scripts</h3>
                            <p>In pre-Islamic days, writing was known to the peoples of the Arabian peninsula, and a rudimentary
                                Arabic script was in use. It was rudimentary because they had little use for it, being a culture
                                with a strong oral tradition, and the earliest texts that have come to us show all the
                                awkwardness of a system that hasn't yet found its legs.</p>
                            <div class="content-img">
                                <img src="../img/baiviet01/early-script.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                                <i>Samples of early Arabic texts right up to the birth of Islam</i>
                            </div>
                            <p>Then, almost overnight, they found themselves in the possession of something that needed to be
                                preserved not only word for word, but down to the pauses between the words. That was the Qur'an,
                                and it required a worthy transcription, with Arabic acquiring a special status, being seen as
                                the language God chose for His revelation. The letters of the alphabet were now magical beings
                                since they were capable of holding and preserving the divine Word. </p>
                            <p>So the early scribes gave the script a makeover: Kufic was the first Arabic script to be made
                                consciously beautiful. These were still days when those in charge of reciting the Qur'an knew it
                                by heart, so the practical aspect of legibility was of secondary concern: much more important
                                was the sheer beauty of the text, its balance, harmony, and the feeling of wonder it
                                inspired.</p>
                            <div class="content-img">
                                <img src="../img/baiviet01/frontispiece.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                                <i>Abbasid dynasty Qur'an (8th or 9th c.)</i>
                            </div>
                            <p>This was an exciting time for calligraphy, when no rules yet existed and calligraphers played in
                                a field of endless possibilities. The system that crystallized was coherent, but not pinned down
                                to forms: Kufic is an essential system, where form can be constantly reinvented.
                            </p>
                            <p>Thus we see versions of it that are adapted to the medium of ink on vellum, and others suitable
                                for stone, mosaic or even brickwork (the world's first "pixel" fonts!), all recognizable as
                                Kufic, but no two really identical. One variant, variously called Eastern Kufic or Broken
                                Cursive, is slender with dynamic contrasts and diagonals, as if influenced by round styles but
                                without losing Kufic traits. The one Kufic style that can really be pinned down is Square Kufic,
                                and that because it's the most minimal possible form of Arabic script.

                            <h3>Rise of the Round Scripts</h3>
                            <p>On the other hand, in the Mashriq ("sunrise" or "East", the Levant and Middle East), where the
                                capitals of the Muslim world were always situated, vast amounts of administrative work meant a
                                multitude of professional scribes, and that inevitably led to the rise of cursive or round
                                scripts, quicker to write and more adapted to the smaller scale of letters and official
                                documents.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Eventually attempts were made to elevate a round script to the status of Kufic, to make it
                                worthy of sacred texts, particularly because paper appeared on the scene, and as a surface had
                                properties quite different from vellum.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This was likely a gradual evolution, but folklore attributes to one man, Ibn Muqlah, a
                                revolutionary invention, turning him into the legendary father of classical Islamic calligraphy.
                                He is said to have invented a system of proportions so that all the letters are based on the
                                height of the Alif, which itself is drawn in relation to the thickness of the pen used.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Comparison</h3>
                            <p>The round scripts are called in Arabic al-khatt al-mans√ªb, which is "the script that conforms,
                                that is regulated". That is the main difference with Kufic: the round scripts are formal. There
                                are very specific rules to write each letter and connect them together, rules to be practiced
                                till the hand follows them automatically. </p>
                            <p>
                                This is to great effect, but at the expense of creative freedom. Indeed it was the mark of a
                                great calligrapher that his work looked as if no human hand had been involved in it, let alone
                                his own personality. This is why round scripts are simpler to teach (literally a no-brainer),
                                but more demanding to master.
                            </p>
                            <p>Kufic, in contrast, is tricky to teach and demands much participation and subtlety from the
                                student, but as it is an approach rather than a visual formula, each student's work is then
                                uniquely their own. As my teacher put it: "The return to Kufic is the return to the moment of
                                first creation."</p>
                            <h2>The Alphabet</h2>
                            <p>You don't have to speak Arabic to work with khatt, and in fact this script is used for a number
                                of languages including Persian and Urdu. But you do need a certain intimacy with the letters, so
                                in this first tutorial, before starting to learn calligraphy or "beautiful writing", we need to
                                learn writing itself.</p>
                            <p>The Arabic and Latin alphabets originate in the same, Phoenician alphabet. They therefore have
                                similarities (by and large the letters match, for instance), but they are also very different in
                                other respects. Here are the features to be aware of, that a Western user may find most
                                challenging:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Arabic is written from right to left.</li>
                                <li>There are 28 letters, but many of them are differentiated by dots, so there are in fact only
                                    18 letterforms (morphemes) for the 28 sounds (phonemes). That's a lot less to learn when we
                                    look at the letters in detail.
                                </li>
                                <li>There are no vowels; vowel sounds are indicated by a system of diacritics I will detail in a
                                    later lesson. This is entirely optional! Most of the time we don't indicate these sounds at
                                    all. In khatt, they can be added for extra ornamental effect, or ignored altogether.
                                </li>
                                <li>Hyphenation does not exist. A word has to end on the same line it begins.</li>
                                <li>Letters have no capital forms. Instead, their form changes depending on their position in
                                    the word (initial, medial, final, or isolated). This sounds more complicated than it
                                    actually is, because few letters change dramatically. Several only really have one form. The
                                    real point to pay attention to is whether they connect or not (see next point).
                                </li>
                                <li>In Latin scripts (for instance in English), letters are connected in handwriting or
                                    calligraphy, and disconnected when they are printed. In Arabic, it depends on the letters.
                                    All letters can connect on the right, but some letters won't connect on the left. A poetic
                                    tradition says these are angelic letters, because they are attached to their origin (God)
                                    but detached from what follows (the world). When I speak of non-connecting letters, I refer
                                    to those that don't connect on the left.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Here are the letters, arranged to group similar shapes together, in a sequence known as the
                                graphic sequence (used in modern dictionaries). This chart shows the letters' isolated form
                                only, and how groups of letters share the same letterform. It also gives you their names, which
                                are useful to know, and the sounds they correspond to, which is not so important for our
                                purposes.</p>

                                purposes.)</p>
